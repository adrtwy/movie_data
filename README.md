# movie_data
In this project, I create a movie database with a variety of reference tables. Then, I use the tables to answer a handful of questions:
* Which film has the largest number of characters in the database?
* Which films have a female sidekick?
* For a specific film id, what actors are in it?
* For a specific film title, calculate the proportion of women to men.
* Which 10 actors have the most films in the database?

This project uses MySQL, to query, create variables, and create CTEs to extract information from the data.

The data used to build the database was sampled from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_movies).
